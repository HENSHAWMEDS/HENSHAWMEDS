# ABOUT ME...
I love Markdown More than Football.

*Little codes for great Impact*

**Thank You M.B**


I am passionate about health and how tech can solve problems in health.

I love Music, the genre doesn't really matter.

I am a "controlled low pressure" individual which makes being proactive in a new space more difficult.

I love driving.

<!--I am keeping the "!!" for M.B---->
WARM REGARDS!!
