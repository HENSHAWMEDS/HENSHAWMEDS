# ABOUT ME...
[*Little codes for great Impact*]

I love Markdown More than Football.

I am passionate about health and how tech can solve problems in health.

I am interested in using Data science and tech to solve medicine supply chain problems in underesounced regions and durring emergencies.

I love Music, the genre doesn't really matter.

I am a "controlled low pressure" individual which makes being proactive in a new space more difficult.

I love driving.
